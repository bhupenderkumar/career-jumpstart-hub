**3. The Pipeline Architecture:**
```
Input → Preprocessing → AI Processing → Post-processing → Output
```
- Used in: Data processing, content generation, analysis
- Benefits: Clear separation of concerns, easy testing
- Challenges: Pipeline orchestration, error handling"

### Real-World AI Application Examples

**Customer Service Platforms:**

## Part 4: Technical Implementation Deep Dive

### AI Service Architecture Patterns
"Let's examine the technical patterns that make AI applications robust:

**Model Management:**
```typescript
interface AIModelConfig {
  name: string;
  endpoint: string;
  maxTokens: number;
  temperature: number;
  fallbackModel?: string;
  costPerToken: number;
}
```

**Context Management:**
```typescript
interface ConversationContext {
  sessionId: string;
  userPreferences: UserProfile;
  conversationHistory: Message[];
  domainContext: DomainSpecificData;
  metadata: ContextMetadata;
}
```

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Graceful degradation when AI services fail

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
class SecureAIService {
  private sanitizeInput(input: string): string {
    // Remove potential injection attempts
    // Validate input length and format
    // Apply content filtering
  }

  private validateOutput(output: string): boolean {
    // Check for sensitive information leakage
    // Validate content appropriateness
    // Ensure format compliance
  }
}
```"
